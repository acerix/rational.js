rational.js
===========

javascript tools and libraries based around rational numbers.

rational.js's architecture is heavily inspired by glMatrix (http://glmatrix.net/), a high performance matrix and vector library.

Many of the glMatrix's methods are available in rational.js, and the parameters are consistent.
